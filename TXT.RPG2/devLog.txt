Hello everyone!

Today marks the first update in the beta phase - Beta 1.1

In the past week I have added the new island of Gazeus, the ability to save in your houses,
walking now costs stamina depending on the terrain and I have done some minor balancing changes to the enemy stats.

The plan for next weeks update is mostly related to backend functions regarding locatins and some QoL changes.
But I will also be adding the beg optiion to markets where you can get money for free but you might also lose hp.

But after next week I will add another Island

Open to suggestions for future islands, towns, creatures or any other features you would like to see added.
Also if you find any bugs or balancing issues please report them.

That's it for now, see you next week!

PixCell.
